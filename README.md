# Trace-generation-and-analysis-for-Multi-threaded-programs
This repository makes use of PIN tool to generate the traces for Multi-threaded programs, and performs analysis of these traces on parameters like access distance and sharing profile.

This was implemented as assignment in the course Advanced Computer Architecture at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur in Autumn sem 2020.

## Abstract
We are given four multithreaded programs named prog1.c, prog2.c, prog3.c and prog4.c

 We written a PIN tool named 'part1.cpp' to generate the trace files for each of these programs. Then after generating the trace we performed analysis of the trace as mentioned in the [assignment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JGCHmTHJ76iQ130YRTRxn0jaa_K-z8vj/view?usp=sharing).

 For setting up the PIN tool, use this [process](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13NYshmxFKvMJJSFOJMi-Z8JbgTS8RVYV/view?usp=sharing).

 ## Running the Analysis
 After setting up the PIN tool generate the traces for each of the four programs, and rename them as prog1.out, prog2.out, prog3.out and prog4.out

 Then move these four traces to a directory where source codes for other parts are kept.

Running instructions can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SIRY4PDaIty9FpElvRkkuUxZ1vRY0SaM/view?usp=sharing).
